      <h1>E-Tongue for Dravya Identification</h1>
      <p>
  Our prototype is a smart system that uses different sensors to study herbs. 
  These include taste sensors (an electronic tongue), light-based sensors 
  (NIRS). With these, the system can identify the 
  basic tastes of herbs such as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, astringent, and spicy. 
  It can also check if the herb is mixed with unwanted substances (adulteration) 
  or if its natural quality is damaged.
</p>

<p>
  The system not only tells what the herb is, but also gives more details such as 
  how fresh it is, how long it will stay good (shelf life), and whether it has 
  been stored properly. By combining data, it can even connect 
  a herb to the place where it was grown. This allows us to build a kind of 
  ‚Äúmap of herbs‚Äù based on geography, helping us trace back fake or low-quality 
  products to their source.
</p>

<p>
  
  Our prototype can be used by farmers, industries, and even consumers to quickly 
  check herb quality. Farmers can test their crops before selling, industries can 
  ensure they are using safe raw materials, and customers can feel confident about 
  what they are buying.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, our prototype makes herb checking simple, fast, and reliable. It 
  combines taste testing, adulteration detection, freshness monitoring, and 
  origin mapping into one system. This can improve food safety, support 
  herbal medicine research, and build more trust between producers and consumers.
